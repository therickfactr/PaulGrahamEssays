## Answer

Stubbornness in a person can be attributed to a combination of factors discussed in Paul Graham's essays. In "The Right Kind of Stubborn," Graham emphasizes the importance of persistence[^1] and the ability to keep going despite setbacks. This determination is a key aspect of stubbornness, as it involves a refusal to give up on one's goals. Additionally, in "The Anatomy of Determination," Graham explores the concept of determination[^2] and how it plays a crucial role in achieving success. A stubborn person is often driven by a strong sense of determination to overcome obstacles and reach their objectives. Furthermore, in "How to Think for Yourself," Graham discusses the importance of independent thinking[^3] and the ability to resist external influences. A stubborn individual may exhibit a strong sense of independence and a willingness to stand by their beliefs, even in the face of opposition.
