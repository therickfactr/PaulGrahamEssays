## Answer

An angel investor is an individual who provides financial backing to startups in their early stages[^1]. They typically invest their own money and are often entrepreneurs themselves who have experience in building successful companies[^2]. Angel investors play a crucial role in the startup ecosystem by providing capital, mentorship, and networking opportunities to help founders grow their businesses[^3].

Angel investors differ from venture capitalists in several ways. They tend to invest smaller amounts of money, have a more hands-on approach with the startups they fund, and are usually more willing to take risks on early-stage companies[^4]. Additionally, angel investors often invest in industries they are familiar with or have expertise in, allowing them to provide valuable insights and guidance to the founders they support[^5].

Overall, angel investors are essential to the success of many startups, as they provide the initial funding and support needed to help early-stage companies grow and thrive in a competitive market[^6].
