## Answer
To be a good founder, one must possess certain qualities that set them apart. Paul Graham emphasizes the importance of determination, flexibility, imagination, and naughtiness[^5]. Determination is crucial because building a startup is a long and challenging journey, requiring founders to persevere through obstacles[^5]. Flexibility is necessary as startups often need to pivot or change direction based on feedback and market conditions[^5]. Imagination allows founders to envision new possibilities and solutions to problems, driving innovation[^5]. Naughtiness, or a willingness to break rules when necessary, can be a valuable trait in challenging the status quo and disrupting industries[^5].
